Q
Pass in a new color of your choosing in place of the old one. 
    
Hint: we don’t care what the previous color was.
const [color, setColor] = useState("pink")

setColor(//code here)

A
setColor(pink)


2.

Q 
Toggle between the colors pink and blue. If the current color is pink, we want to set it to blue. If it’s currently blue, set it back to pink.

const [color, setColor] = useState("pink")

setColor(//code here)

A 
setColor(prevColor => prevColor === "pink" ? "blue" : "pink")



3. 

Q 
Add a new person object to the following people array in state. You can hard-code a new object but it must be a person object with firstName and lastName properties.

const [people, setPeople] = useState([
	{
		firstName: "John",
		lastName: "Smith"
	}
])

setPeople(//code here)

A 
setPeople(prevPeople => {
    return [
        ...prevPeople, 
        {
            firstName: "Ben",
            lastName: "Jonson"
        }
    ]
})


4. 

Q
Change the following state-setting functions to use an implicit return

const [colors, setColors] = setState(["pink", "blue"])

setColors(prevColors => {
	return [...prevColors, "green"]
})

const [countObject, setCountObject] = setState({
	count: 0
})

setCountObject(prevState=> {
	return {
		count: prevState.count + 1
	}
})


A 
setColors(prevColor => [...prevColors, "green"])

B 
setCountObject(prevState => ({count:  prevState.count + 1}))



5. 

Q 
Update the following state to add an additional property age and set the value to 30, ensuring that the other properties are not overwritten.

const [person, setPerson] = useState({
		firstName: "John",
		lastName: "Smith"
})

setPerson(//code here)

A 
setPerson(prevPerson => ({...prevPerson, age: 30}))


6. 

Q
What’s wrong with the following state update?
const [colors, setColors] = useState(["pink", "blue"])

setColors("green")

A 
It doesn't add a new color to the existing array, it just replaces it with the string green. You would need to use a spread operator to include the pre-existing array then add it to that array. Just like they did in question 4
